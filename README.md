# CryptPY-Algorithms

Our task at hand is to break codes... Beginners, loose the fear of coding.

We need to collect as many as crypto-algorithms as possible in KWOC period.

## Get Started
```git clone https://github.com/AmulyaReddy99/CryptPY-Algorithms.git```

Run `python3 crypto.py`, before this go through the code.
Code consists of few algorithms but not called. To see their functionality call them with appropriate function names.
You can add any number of algorithms here. Creating an interface with Tkinter would be helpful.
For example, you can code for 
 - Jeffersonâ€™s cylinder Cipher
 - Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
 - EFS
 
> Note: Algorithms can be non-text files(img, binary files, audio files etc..) must not be included in crypto.py. 

PRs are welcomed, Happy coding time!
