Our task at hand is to break codes... Beginners, loose the fear of coding.

We need to collect as many as crypto-algorithms as possible in KWOC period.

##Get Started
```git clone https://github.com/AmulyaReddy99/CryptPY-Algorithms```

Run `python3 crypto.py`, before this go through the code.
Code consists of few algorithms but not called. To see their functionality call them with appropriate function names.
You can add any number of algorithms here. Creating an interface with Tkinter would be helpful.

PRs are welcomed, Happy coding time!
